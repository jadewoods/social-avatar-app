Social Avatar Rooms


A minimalist social app where users express their status, mood, and activity through customizable avatars and dynamic rooms. Instead of text posts, users update their environment — workspaces, restaurants, outdoors, clubs, cozy rooms — and friends can tap in to see what everyone is up to.



This project is built as a learning journey while I develop skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with later plans for backend functionality.

//Features (MVP Goals)
User Avatars

Basic customizable characters

Clothing, colors, expressions

Rooms / Scenes

Users choose or design a “room” that represents their activity

Examples: Work desk, café, gym, restaurant, outdoors

All visual — no text required

Activity Feed (Visual)

Friends can browse each other’s rooms

Rooms update as users change their environment

Minimal UI

Almost no words; icons and visuals drive the experience

//Roadmap


Phase 1 — Frontend Foundations (Current)
Basic project structure (index.html, styles.css, script.js)

Static avatar creator

Static room selector

First demo views for user profiles and “room cards”



Phase 2 — Interactivity
Store avatar + room selection in browser (localStorage)

Animated transitions between rooms

UI improvements + icons



Phase 3 — Backend & Social Features
User accounts & authentication

Friends list

Real-time room updates

Database to store avatars + room data



Phase 4 — Polishing
Better art assets

Sound design

Mobile-friendly layout

User settings + themed rooms

//Tech Stack
HTML5 — layout, structure

CSS3 — responsive UI, animations, custom UI components

JavaScript — interactivity, state management

(Future) Node.js or Supabase/Firebase for backend

(Optional) Canvas / SVG for avatar



//Learning Goals
Practice clean project structure

Build real-world UI components

Learn state management in vanilla JavaScript

Prepare for backend integration

Gain experience with GitHub workflow

//Contributions


This project is primarily for personal learning and experimentation, but ideas, suggestions, and improvements are welcome.

Status


Work in progress — early prototype phase.

More visuals, animations, and interactivity coming soon.
